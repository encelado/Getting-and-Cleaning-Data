# Getting and Cleaning Data
## Course Project

This project consists in one R script called run_analysis.R which:

1. reads a data set collected from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [1] and available from the course website [2].
2. creates a tidy data set containing the average of the mean and standard deviation grouped by activity and subject.
3. writes the computed data set in the 'dataset_avg.txt' file.
